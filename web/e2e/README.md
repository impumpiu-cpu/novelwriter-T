# E2E Pressure Matrix

Use E2E first to discover real failure modes, then sink each discovered issue into the lowest stable deterministic test layer.

Current pressure priorities for Studio world-entry:

- upload handoff:
  uploaded novels should stay behind the preparation gate until ingest/bootstrap handoff is terminal
- first-entry contract:
  imported novels that already reached a ready writing state must not reopen empty-world onboarding on first Studio launch
- bootstrap click pressure:
  repeated clicks while extraction is pending must not issue duplicate triggers
- bootstrap failed recovery:
  failed extraction should expose a retry/re-extract action with stable copy
- pending marker stability:
  route reload/back/forward should not strand Studio in a fake running state

Test layering:

- `web/e2e/mock/**`: exploratory and deterministic browser probes with controlled API timing
- `web/e2e/integration/**`: thin end-to-end chain validation against the real backend stack
- `web/src/__tests__/**`: sink stable semantics here after pressure tests reveal the real failure mode

Rule:

Do not add broad new deterministic tests before a pressure probe reveals the concrete drift risk.

## Hosted Credential Profiles

Integration E2E must not hardcode personal hosted accounts.

Supported resolution order:

1. explicit `LoginOptions`
2. optional env-selected profile via `E2E_HOSTED_PROFILE`
3. default hosted env vars

Example local profile for a machine-only account:

```bash
E2E_HOSTED_PROFILE=OMEGA_LOCAL_VERIFY
E2E_HOSTED_OMEGA_LOCAL_VERIFY_NICKNAME=...
E2E_HOSTED_OMEGA_LOCAL_VERIFY_PASSWORD=...
E2E_HOSTED_OMEGA_LOCAL_VERIFY_USERNAME=...
E2E_HOSTED_OMEGA_LOCAL_VERIFY_INVITE_CODE=...
```

Use profile env only in local/private config such as untracked `.env`, never in repo-tracked tests.
